#+TITLE: Week 06 - Video Notes

* Introduction to Classes and Objects - Part 1 (Data Structures & Algorithms # 3)
- an /object/ is a collection of properties and functions
- objects can be stored in variables
- /instance variables/ or /attributes/ are the properties of an object
- the functions are called /methods/
- a /class/ is a blueprint to make objects
  + a class does not refer to any specific object
- a common convention is to name a class with a starting capital letter
- `this` refers to the object running the function
  + not always needed, but can provide extra clarity
- a /constructor/ is a function that allows the creation of an object from a class while setting the attributes for the object
* Classes & Objects | C++ | Tutorial 27
- a /class/ is a new data type
- classes are prefixed with `class`
- an /object/ is an instance of a class
