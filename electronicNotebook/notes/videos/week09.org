#+TITLE: Week 09 - Video Notes

* What is encapsulation in programming?
- makes code safer to execute
- making an entity private keeps another from accessing it
  + another entity can access one marked public
- you do not want to override the behavior of scope
- encapsulation allows you encapsulate things that should not be modified by other parts of your code
* Java Programming Tutorial 62 - Encapsulation
- the three big pieces of Object-Oriented Programming
  1. encapsulation
  2. inheritance
  3. polymorphism
- the whole idea of encapsulation is to hide the inner details
  + mainly used with class-level variables
- uses /getter/ and /setter/ methods to work with encapsulated variables
  + getters retrieve the variable
  + setters change the value of the variable
- can swap out the structure without needing to change the interface with encapsulation
* C++ Programming Tutorial 89 - Encapsulation
- the two concepts of encapsulation are:
  1. /abstraction/ - the inner workings of the class do not need to be known to use it
  2. /control/ - control over what someone can see of and do with our class
