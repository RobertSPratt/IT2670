#+TITLE: Week 06 - Vocabulary

- /complexity/ - a measure of the effort expended by the computer in performing a computation, relative to the size of the computation
- /count-controlled loop/ - a loop that executes a specified number of times
- /event-controlled loop/ - a loop that terminates when something happens inside the loop bosy to signal that the loop should be exited
- /event counter/ - a variable that is incremented each time a particular event occurs
- /flag/ - a Boolean variable that is used to control the logical flow of a program
- /increment/ - to increase by one
- /infinite loop/ - a loop that never exits
- /initialize/ - to set the initial value of a variable
- /iteration/ - an individual pass through, or repitition of, the body of a loop
- /iteration counter/ - a counter variable that is incremented with each iteration of a loop
- /logical order/ - the order in which the programmer wants the statements to be executed in a program
- /loop/ - a control structure that causes a statement or group of statements to be executed repeatedly
- /loop control variable/ - a variable used in a count-controlled loop's loop test
- /loop entry/ - the point at which the flow of control reaches the first statement inside a loop
- /loop exit/ - the point at which the repetition of the loop body ends and control passes to the first statement following the loop
- /loop test/ - the point at which the `while` expression is evaluated and the decision is made either to begin a new iteration or to skip to the statement immediately following the loop
- /physical order/ - the order in which the statements appear in a program
- /priming read/ - reading the first set of values before entering the loop
- /sentinel/ - (/trailer value/) used to signal the program that no more data remains to be processed
- /termination condition/ - the condition that causes a loop to be exited
