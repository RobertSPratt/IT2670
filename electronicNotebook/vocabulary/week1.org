- /algorithm/ - a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem in a finite amount of time
- /arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)/ - the component of the central processing unit that performs arithmetic and logical operations
- /assembly language/ - a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each of the machine language instructions for a particular computer
- /assembler/ - a program that translates an assembly language program into machine code
- /auxiliary storage device/ - a device that stores data in encoded form outside the computer's main memory
- /Central Processing Unit (CPU)/ - processes instructions from the motherboard in a four step cycle; made up of the arithmetic/logic unit and the control unit

- /compiler/ - takes the program and translates it into machine code
- /compiling/ - translating the program into machine code
- /computer/ - a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data

- /data/ - information in the form a computer can use
- /debugging/ - finding a problem within the code
- /documentation/ - the written text and comments that make a program oasier for others to understand, use, and modify
- /executing/ - running a program on a computer
- /hardware/ - the physical components of a computer
- /implementation/ - the combination of coding and testing an algorithm
- /infinite loop/ - a never-ending situation in an algorithm
- /information/ - any knowledge that can be communicated
- /input/output (I/O) devices/ - the parts of the computer that accept data to be processed (input) and present the results of that processing (output)
- /interactive system/ A system that allows direct communication between user and computer
- /interpreter/ - translates a program one statement at a time
- /machine code/ - a series of instructions scheduled by the operating system and fetched by the CPU
- /machine language/ - (also called /machine code/) the language, made up of binarey coded instructions, that is used directly by the computer
- /malware/ - software written with malicious purposes in mind
- /memory unit/ - internal data storage in a computer
- /object program/ - the machine language version of a source program
- /operating system/ - a set of programs that manages all of the computer's resources
- /peripheral device/ - an input, output, or auxiliary storage device attached to a computer
- /programming language/ - a set of rules, symbols, and special words used to construct a computer program
- /software/ - computer programs; the set of all programs available on a computer
- /software piracy/ - the unauthorized copying of software for either personal use or use by others
- /source program/ - a program written in a high-level programming language
- /user/computer interface/ - a connecting link that translates between the computer's internal representation of data and representations that humans are able to work with
- /virus/ - malicious code that replicates and spreads to other computers through email messages and file sharing, without authorization, and possibly with the intent of doing harm
- /worm/ - malicious code that replicates and spreads to other computers through security gaps in the computer's operating system, without authorization, and possibly with the intent of doing harm
- /zombie/ - a computer that has been taken over for unauthorized use, such as sending spam email
